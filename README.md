t_swift vector
==============
- Just think, while you've been getting down and out about the segfaults and buffer overflows of the world, you could've been getting down to this sick vector.
- Using this vector is easy. Just put in your working directory and insert ```#include "t_swift_vector.h"``` into your header file.
